_(Day 16)_

It’s been awhile! I’m sitting down to write this to both fully flesh out what I’ve been through these past two weeks but also to fulfill my first blog assignment for Flatiron. The blog assignments are staggered throughout the course and will be a good reminder to take a break from reading code and start writing about it.

**Flatiron’s Question**: Why did you decide to learn software development?

I’ve realized this question has changed several times from the initial search for a program to actually starting at Flatiron but it typically revolves around a few points.

* The desire to be in a field with continuous learning.
* Having a career that involves creating and problem solving
* Accepting a new challenge. See cliches including “never get comfortable”
* Deeper understanding of my lifetime hobby of fooling with computers

Each day in the Flatiron program is reassuring that these goals are being achieved at what sometimes seems like a break-neck pace and others, a snails. Though I am 5-6 years out of the learning environment, I have to say this seems harder than any learning I did in college. There are significant ebbs each week which are best represented by one of my recent tweets of passion.

I have learned, struggled, and grown to a new level of resilience these past two weeks. The Flatiron Full Stack Web Development course has been quite the challenge and I am accepting it with open arms at each turn.
