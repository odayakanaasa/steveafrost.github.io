_(Day 84)_

Through nearly three months of studying at Flatiron for Full-Stack Development, I have refined a collection of helpful habits and resources as well as found what to avoid - see: Rabbit Holes - and am always eager to share with other students in hopes that it will help them as it helped me. Actually, much of what I use on a day-to-day was passed down from others, like age old stories. My hope is that by sharing here, others will find their helpful utensil and continue the tradition of standing on others shoulders.
