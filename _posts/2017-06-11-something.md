My brief understanding of it is that it is a preferred way to avoid SQL Injection attacks. After reading around some about it, it sounds a lot like Active Record for Ruby. It is an abstraction on top of typical SQL commands that makes accessing the database more predictable and secure."

Reading programming books is an essential part of learning for me, half because I learn well by seeing examples and half because I spend so much time on the subway in the morning and evening. Having a book like [PHP The Right Way](http://www.phptherightway.com) or You Don't Know JS let's me fill in gaps in my knowledge while zipping through the dim tunnels of Manhattan & Brooklyn.

Since I've been diving into PHP lately, I've been working my way through the former book and came upon the [SQL chapter](http://www.phptherightway.com/#pdo_extension) which had something interesting: PHP Data Objects, or PDO. My brief understanding of it is that it is a preferred way to avoid SQL Injection attacks (see [Privacy Day post](https://steveafrost.com/protect-yoself-data-privacy-day-2017)). After reading around some about it, it sounds a lot like Active Record for Ruby. That is, it's an abstraction on top of typical SQL commands that makes accessing the database more predictable and secure.

This will be my next deep dive topic that I hope to read more into tomorrow and update this post with my findings.
