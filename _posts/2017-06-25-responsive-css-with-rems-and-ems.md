Amongst several extremely useful features, CSS3 brought us REMs & EMs - two responsive-minded measurement units. In my experience, these units tend to be more predictable and adaptable than the usual style of pixels and percents though those are still good for things such as border-widths and the like. Today I'll outline exactly what REMs & EMs are, their journey to cross-browser support, and the benefits in using them.

### What are REMs & EMs
In this instance, the dictionary definition does a lot of good to know and rounds out a ground floor to come in on.

* REM: stands for the text size of the root element on the webpage.

* EM: historically, em was a measurement based on the width of the capital M letter. In modern web design, it is more commonly equated to roughly 16 pixels.

Now, in layman's terms: a REM is based on whatever root text size you're using in your HTML selector. On the other hand, an EM inherits from what comes before it. Consider the following:

```html
html { font-size: 100%;} // FYI: in most browsers 100% = 16px;
body { font-size: 20px;}

.first { font-size: 1rem; }
.second { font-size: 1em; }

<html>
  <body>
    <div class="first">
      <p>I'm using REMs here which rely on the root element</p> 
    </div>
    <div class="second">
      <p>I'm using EMs here which inherit from the parent element
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

In my `<div class="first">`, my font size will be 16px because REMs are based on the root element, or the 100% font size within my HTML. While it's only on letter difference, the EMs are doing their own thing. Over in the `<div class="second">`, the font size would be 20px because it inherits from it's parent, or `<body>` in this case where the font size is set to 20px.

### How Did REMs & EMs Get Here?

CSS3 had a long, tattered road to walk/crawl before any spec was fully published. From what [I've read](https://1stwebdesigner.com/css3-in-a-nutshell/), it was about 12 years in-between CSS2 & CSS3 and the implementation of CSS3 wasn't even the full spec but rather the code was modularized and published as single purpose entities. The latest module to come out was in 2012 and is something we hold dearly â€“ media queries!

### Benefits of REMs & EMs

Benefits coming shortly! I'll update this post in the morning.
