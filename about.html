<h2>About Me</h2>

<div class="aboutme">
	<ul class="recent">
    <p>I've been a technology enthusiast as far back as I can remember, whether it was building custom computers for friends, helping a local business with a website, or getting caught sneaking on the family computer late at night in my high school years.</p>

    <p>It was natural then that I progressed to learning how to operate computers in my college years. In college I spent spare hours, late hours learning HTML/CSS/Javascript and tinkering with the first smart phones - think Windows Mobile 6.1 Pocket PC.</p>

    <p>After a few years in the professional field, I realized I wanted to get back into programming. Currently, I am learning Full-Stack Web Development which has been such a growing experience. Each day I look forward to the creative expression and critical thinking opportunities that arise when learning and developing.</p>

    <p>When I'm not coding, I am usually riding my bike - either on casual trips or in organized tours. If it is Saturday or Sunday morning, chances are good you'll find me at the garden, pantry, or library volunteering with NYCares.</p>
